This folder is about unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time series data.

THe data set is retrieved from https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/791/metropt+3+dataset. 

In this notebook, I have implemented three algorithms for anomaly detection
- Isolation Forest
- One Class SVM
- LSTM Auto Encoder
